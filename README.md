## RestApi using Django, Flask and Fastapi

I have created CRUD operation restfull API using Django, Flask and FastApi.
All the above frameworks are Python web-framwework. Lets discuss one by one


#### Django rest framwork
  REST APIs are an industry-standard way for web services to send and receive data. They use HTTP request methods to facilitate the request-response cycle and typically transfer data using JSON, and more rarely - HTML, XML and other formats
  
#### Flask 
  Flask is a popular micro framework for building web applications. Since it is a micro-framework, it is very easy to use and lacks most of the advanced functionality which is found in a full-fledged framework.
  
#### FastApi
  FastAPI is a modern, python-based high-performance web framework used to create Rest APIs. Its key features are that is fast, up to 300% faster to code, fewer bugs, easy to use, and production-friendly.
